    Unknown Quantities (UQ) is a yearly journal, created as a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/communication-and-graphic-design/postgraduate/ma-graphic-communication-design-csm" target="_blank">MA GCD</a> and <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/curation-and-culture/postgraduate/ma-culture-criticism-and-curation-csm" target="_blank">MA CCC</a> courses at Central Saint Martins.<br>
    Each year a handful of students are selected from both courses, and given free reign to create an experimental publication on any topic.<br>
    <br>
    For the 11th edition, our chosen theme was time. Specifically <u>the way time can manifest both pysically and emotionally</u>.<br>
    <br>
    UQ11 pays tribute to the conept of time through many different design decisions:<br>
    The publication has no cover and is spiral bound, refering to the limitless nature of time and the circularity of clocks, UQ11 allows the reader to navigate the magazine freely with no begining or end.<br>
    The 24 pieces split into seven 12-page secttions evoke the day/night cycle, the 24-hour day, the calendar week, month, and year.<br>
    As we printed, the risograph ink changed throughout the run, fading and intensifying at different times. The soy-based ink can smudge at any time after printing, allowing each copy to change over time depending now how it is handled.

        The UQ11 launch event was hosted on the 26th Jan 2024, at Kiosk N1C, Coal Drops Yard, London.
